# JavaScript Product Management App

This is a simple product management web application built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add new products with name, price, quantity, image URL, and category
- View all products in a responsive card layout
- Edit or delete products
- Search products by name
- Filter products by category
- Sort products by price (low to high, high to low)
- Increase or decrease product quantity directly from the product card
- All data is stored in the browser's localStorage

## Features

- **Add Product:** Fill out the form to add a new product. Each product includes a name, price, quantity, image URL, and category.
- **View Products:** Products are displayed as cards with all details and action buttons.
- **Edit/Delete:** Use the Edit and Delete buttons on each card to update or remove products.
- **Search:** Use the search bar to find products by name (case-insensitive).
- **Filter:** Use the category dropdown to filter products by category.
- **Sort:** Use the sort dropdown to sort products by price.
- **Quantity Controls:** Use the + and - buttons to adjust product quantity directly from the card.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view and manage products.
2. Use the form (on `index1.html`) to add new products.
3. Use the search, filter, and sort controls to find and organize products.
4. All changes are saved automatically in your browser's localStorage.
